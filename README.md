# Fake-Gree-server
Fake Gree server implementation to mitigate the need to let Gree/Syen HVAC units do homecalls at all, starting from the registration.
**It works for both Gree and Syen HVAC units** _(As Syen is mostly produced by Gree. My Syen literally has a Gree WiFi module with a Gree MAC address)_

# Why?
Because Gree and Syen HVAC units' WiFi control does not work unless they can register to a server successfully and then keep a heartbeat connection up from time to time. I really dislike the idea of having any of my IoT devices wander the internet on their own, despite the fact I (as any sane person should too) keep them in a very well separated IoT network. If you can prevent any home-calls, why shouldn't you? :)<br>
For me starting from 18-01-2025 gree servers ( eu.dis.gree.com and dis.gree.com ) seems to have problems and as a result HA integration will not work any more so I have to set-up the Fake server to be able to control my AC unit located in amother location.

# How it's working
You need to have your Gree unit connected to wifi, it is already connected on your wifi there is no need to reset the unit.<br>
If you reset your unit's WiFi, you can register following the registration procedure described in the next points (and in the fake server log on startup) and you forget about it.

# Prerequisites
There are some things you need to have working before you can use this hack solution:
* A DNS server serving (at least) the (separate?) network onto which the HVAC unit will be connected to
* A DNS override of `eu.dis.gree.com` to the IP address of this fake server _(implicated reserving a static ip for the server)_
* You could additionally block all other connections sourcing from the HVAC unit except for DNS requests towards your DNS server and TCP/1812 towards this fake server
* For the registration / activation process you'll need a WiFi and Python3 capable device _(laptop or possibly some phones)_

# Setting it all up
1. Download, review, edit to your needs or simply jump to building & running the fake sever. _(The bare minimum you should probably change is the IP address in the gree_server.service or docker-compose.yml files to fit into your subnet in which the HVAC unit will reside too.)_
`docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d`<br>
test it after you changed the IP/location for your server with:<br>
`python3 /opt/fakegree/gree_server.py <SERVER_IP> 1812 eu.dis.gree.com`<br>and if it is ok you can set-up and start the service in linux.<br>
2. Turn off the HVAC unit and reset the WiFi settings _(MODE + WIFI usually)_
3. Wait ~ 2 minutes and once the HVAC unit's WiFi comes online, connect to it from a laptop or some other device! (SSID will be the last few bytes of its MAC address, the password is `12345678`)
4. Run `python3 register.py YOUR_WIFI'S_SSID YOUR_WIFI'S_PASSWORD`
5. In a few seconds the fake server should be receiving all sorts of connections and everything will be working.

# Limitations
* I don't think the usualy Gree applications work like this, at all. They don't really, for me, at least. **Homeassistant** is an amazing project and it works flawlessly, however! _(Including the automatic discovery and all!)_ Check it out, so much better than the stock apps anyway [with zero homecalls :)]  Thanks to RobHofmann's https://github.com/RobHofmann/HomeAssistant-GreeClimateComponent )_ 
* Nothing else really. After setting all up I tried shutting down the fake server for a few hours and then firing it back up. The HVAC unit tolerated it nicely, nothing stopped working. I can imagine having the fake server not running for a very long time could cause the HVAC unit to lose its s#*t and start the discovery process again but that would work just fine too since the DNS for the discovery server _(dis.gree.com)_ is overriden :)
* Absolutely worst case you need to do the registration procedure again. It takes < 1 min. and I never had to do it again, save for the testing. _(In HomeAssistant after re-registrations you may need to reload the Gree module - no need to restart HomeAssistant!)_
